# Predictive-Heart-Rate-Monitoring-System

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, highlighting the urgent need for real-time health monitoring and early detection systems. This project integrates an IoT-based wearable device with predictive machine learning models to deliver a smart, end-to-end heart health monitoring solution.

The system combines:

Real-time physiological monitoring using MAX30100 sensor and NodeMCU (ESP8266),

Cloud-based data storage via ThingSpeak for remote access,

AI-driven heart disease prediction using models like Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression,

Interactive Web Interface built with Flask for seamless user interaction.
