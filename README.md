# Predictive-Heart-Rate-Monitoring-System

The increasing prevalence of long-term illnesses and the rising impact of cardiovascular diseases as a leading cause of mortality have highlighted the urgent need for accessible, real-time health monitoring and early detection systems. In response, we present a comprehensive solution that seamlessly integrates real-time hardware monitoring with advanced Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) techniques to enable users to proactively assess their heart health.
The system comprises a MAX30100 sensor and a NodeMCU (ESP8266) microcontroller, which act as the physical backbone for capturing vital physiological parameters such as heart rate and blood oxygen saturation (SpO‚ÇÇ). These vitals are displayed on an OLED screen in real-time for immediate patient feedback allowing physicians and caretakers to monitor the data remotely.
What sets this system apart is the tight coupling of real-time IoT hardware with AIML-driven analytics. A suite of machine learning algorithms‚Äîincluding Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression‚Äîhas been implemented to analyze user-provided health data and accurately predict the risk of heart disease. These models are trained on a medical dataset and embedded into a Flask-based web application, offering users an interactive platform to input their health metrics, view real-time sensor readings, and instantly receive a personalized heart disease risk assessment.
By combining real-time sensing with predictive analytics, this system serves not only as a continuous health monitor but also as an intelligent assistant for early cardiovascular disease detection, offering a powerful tool for both individuals and healthcare providers.
